archetypes
archetypes are used for quickly creating an maven project. these are pre-built project templates created by the maven team and distributed to us through maven central repository.
There are different archetypes for each type of project
1. maven-archetype-quickstart
2. maven-archetype-webapp
3. maven-archetype-j2ee-simple
4. maven-archetype-mojo
5. maven-archetype-archetype

How to create custom archetypes?
There are 2 ways we can create our own custom archetypes
1. using maven-archetype-archetype archetype to create the project from scratch
2. create archetype from an existing project

#2. create archetype from an existing project
1. create an project using the maven archetype based on the type of the project
2. add necessary dependencies, plugins and configuration/code which is common to all the projects of the technology/type you want to develop
3. make sure the project can be build without any errors
4. goto the root directory of the project and run the archetype plugin, create-from-project goal
mvn archetype:create-from-project 
5. it generates an archetype under /target/generated-sources/archetype	

For eg.. we have created an project: teamtech-archetype-springcore
teamtech-archetype-springcore
|-src
  |-main
	  |-java
			|-main
				|-App.java
		|-resources
			|-application-context.xml
	|-test
		|-java			
		|-resources			
|-pom.xml
  |-spring dependencies
	|-plugins
|-target
	|-generated-sources
		|-archetype
			|-archetype-root (archetype)
				|-pom.xml
				|-src
					|-main
						|-java
						|-resources
							|-archetype-resources (project)
								|-pom.xml
								|-src
									|-main
										|-java
											|-main
												|-App.java
										|-resources
											|-application-context.xml
						|-META-INF
							|-maven
								|-archetype-metadata.xml
								
								
Now we can add any configurations further or resources for our project into archetype-resources directory and configure their information in archetype-metadata.xml

|-archetype-root (archetype)
				|-pom.xml
				|-src
					|-main
						|-java
						|-resources
							|-archetype-resources (project)
								|-pom.xml
								|-src
									|-main
										|-java
											|-main
												|-App.java
										|-resources
											|-application-context.xml
						|-META-INF
							|-maven
								|-archetype-metadata.xml
mvn clean install

Plugins

Plugins are the basic building blocks of the maven build process. A maven build comprises of multiple build steps/activities to be performed in building an project. An build activity or step is represented by an maven plugin

Plugin can be treated as component and it contains multiple goals, each goal performs an activity or an action as part of the build process.
	
archetype is a plugin it has multiple goals
|-generate
|-create-from-project

install is a plugin, and it has a goal called "install" to install a local artifact into the maven repository
