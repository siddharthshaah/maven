Maven Build Abstraction / Maven Build Lifecycle
build lifecycle
---------------
There are 3 built-in build lifecycles are there in maven
1. default = handles project build/deployment activities
2. clean = cleaning the generated directories
3. site = generating project documentation

Each lifecycle contains several build phase we can treat these phases as ant Targets or stages of a build process
#1. Phases in default lifecycle
1. validate = validates the project is correct and all information provided is valid or not
2. compile  = compiles the source code
3. test     = test the source code with available unit testcases 
4. package  = packages into a distributable format (jar, war, ear)
5. integration-test = runs the integration testcases
6. verify   = run any checks to verify whether the package is meeting the quality criteria or not
7. install  = install the package into local maven repository
8. deploy   = copies the final package into remove maven repository so that it can be shared to other develpers/teams

For the above phases there are plugins with goals associated to carry the relevant operation at each phase
build an maven project

validate
|-plugin1#goal
|-plugin2#goal
---------------
compile
|-compilePlugin#compile
|-copyResources#copy
-------------------------
test
|-surefireplugin#test
-----------------------

mvn default:package


#2. Phases in clean lifecycle
1. clean
  |-CleanPlugin#clean

#3. phases in site lifecycle
1. site

mvn clean:clean default:verify
mvn clean verify


project1 = mvn clean verify
project2 = mvn clean verify
project3 = mvn clean verify
project4 = mvn clean deploy


#3 build lifecycles are there in maven
an maven lifecycle defines the standard phases in which a build activities should be applied for a project
1. default
2. clean
3. site

each lifecycle has defined pre-defined phases, which are common across all the projects of maven. each phase represents a stage in build process.
every phase has been associated with a plugin/goal to carry activities at that phase.
maven has pre-built plugins with goals and has associated with build lifecycle phases to perform build activities for every maven project 

so developer dont need to know how to build an maven project, what phases are there and how to run the build since across all the projects the phases are same.
